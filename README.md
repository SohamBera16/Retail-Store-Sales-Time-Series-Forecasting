## Project Objective:
Using time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer. The goal is to build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. In order to make accurate predictions and gain insights, the overaall trend and seasonal components of the time series have been analyzed. 

Through analysis, it was found that the overall trend of the unit sales is linear in nature.
